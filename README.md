# fnpm
fnpm is a very simple bitcoin full node monitor node written in nodejs.

The suppose is to give statistics on in Traffic and connected peers on systems running either bitcoind or btcd instances - and to teach me some javascript.

Please note that I don't continue this anymore - I moved the approach to Reactjs. This can be found here: https://github.com/piezzo/fnpm2

# Quickstart

Assuming you already have nodejs installed (if not, get it from https://nodejs.org/):

    download and unzip.
    change into project directory.
    edit config file config/default.json and adapt to your system.
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
